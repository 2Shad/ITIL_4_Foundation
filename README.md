# ITIL 4 Foundation


## **Key Concepts and Definitions**  

### **Service Management**  
Service management is a **set of specialized organizational capabilities** used to **enable value** for customers through services.  
- These capabilities include **people, culture, technology, and processes** that differentiate an organization in the market.  
- Value is created by leveraging these capabilities to provide beneficial services.  

### **Value**  
Value is the **perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something**.  
- **Perception is key**—value is determined by the **customer's experience**, not just the provider’s intent.  

### **Stakeholders in Service Management**  
- **Customer**: Defines service requirements.  
- **User**: Uses the service on a regular basis.  
- **Sponsor**: Authorizes budgets for services.  
- **Supplier**: External partners who help deliver services.  

### **Service**  
A **means of enabling value co-creation**, helping customers achieve desired **outcomes** without requiring them to manage specific **costs and risks**.  

### **Product**  
A **configuration of resources**, created by the organization, that is **potentially valuable** to customers.  

### **Service Offering**  
A **specific mix of services and products** sold to a particular customer. It consists of:  
- **Goods**: Ownership is transferred to the customer.  
- **Access to resources**: The customer is allowed to use resources without owning them.  
- **Service actions**: Activities performed by the service provider for the customer.  

### **Output vs. Outcome**  
- **Output**: A **tangible or intangible deliverable** of an activity.  
- **Outcome**: A **result** for a stakeholder that is enabled by one or more outputs.  
  - Example: In football (soccer), an **output** is scoring a goal, while the **outcome** is winning the championship.  

### **Cost**  
- Can be **removed from the customer** as part of the value proposition (e.g., offering a cheaper alternative).  
- Can be **imposed on the customer**, which is the price they pay for the service.  

### **Risk**  
The **uncertainty of an outcome**, which can be:  
- **Positive (opportunity)**: A chance for gain or improvement.  
- **Negative (hazard)**: A potential issue or threat.  
- Service providers must **manage risks** by understanding **exposure** and **impact** to mitigate potential issues.  

### **Utility (Fit for Purpose)**  
A service must do what it is **meant to do** and provide the required **functionality**.  
- Example: If a webpage is required to have a **blue background**, but it has a **brown background**, then **utility is not met**.  

### **Warranty (Fit for Use)**  
A service must work **well enough** to be usable. This includes:  
- **Availability**  
- **Capacity**  
- **Continuity**  
- **Security**  

The **right level** of warranty is defined by the **customer**, not the provider. **Gold plating** (over-engineering a service) is unnecessary—what matters is meeting the customer's specific needs.  

### **Value Formula**  
**Value = Utility + Warranty (+ Perception)**  
- The right **utility** with the right levels of **warranty** creates value.  
- **Perception** plays a critical role—**a service’s success is based on how the customer experiences it**, not just its technical performance.
